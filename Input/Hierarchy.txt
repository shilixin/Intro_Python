1 Introduction
1.1 Document Purpose
The objective of this document is to describe components of the Medicaid Hierarchy functional and technical design of the UHIP system. This document uses narratives, process flows and business rules to narrate the functionality design.  The document only addresses changes to the Medicaid Hierarchy functionality. It addresses the hierarchy that will be followed if a person were to apply for health coverage online or through paper applications. It does not address the existing design for other DHS programs like SNAP, Rhode Island Works and CCAP. 
1.2 Scope
The scope of this document is defining the functionality and business rules to meet the Medicaid Hierarchy functional requirements for RI UHIP system. 
1.3 References

1.4 Assumptions
The following is a list of assumptions applicable to the Medicaid Hierarchy Updates process design document:
* BHDDH ? DD Client Level of Care Process will be reported by BHDDH Agency in Level of Care Determination screen. 
* All the policy updates required for this design will be incorporated in policy before July 2016 implementation.
* State will provide Conversion rules to convert existing waiver/HCBS code to Care planning services. 
* MMIS File Layout changes are discussed in MMIS Functional Design Document.
* Medicaid Enrollment and QHP Enrollment functionality is discussed in Enrollment functionality.
* Rite Share is a separate process and documented independently in the Rite Share Functional Design Document. 
1.5 Maintenance
This document contains a revision history log. When changes occur, the version number will be updated to the next increment. In addition, the date, the owner making the change, and a change description will be added to the revision history log.  
The final (approved) versions of these documents will be stored in the RI SharePoint site.
2 Change Request Overview
2.1 Business Need/Value
The system shall evaluate the MAGI clients for LTSS services so that the State can claim 100% FMAP match for Expansion populations. Additionally, LTSS Workflow is modified which yield following benefits:
1. Authorization of services are setup at acuity level for each services, which provides flexibility in future to setup payment at acuity level.
2. Existing LTSS programs are modified to align with 1115 Waiver.
Community Medicaid clients can be evaluated for MAGI Medicaid if they lose their disability characteristics. This streamlines the ex-parte process for Community Medicaid clients. SSI clients Exparte review process is automated, so that SSI unit has minimal intervention as opposed to current laborious business task. 
Katie Beckett Eligibility criteria is modified so that applicants are evaluated for MAGI before being determined eligible for Katie Beckett. Additionally, Katie Beckett will no longer be a separate case which provides an option to the Katie Beckett Unit to process required updates on an existing account/case instead of creating a new case. 

MART review is no longer required for LTSS Programs. Clinical/functional disability review by the Office of Medical Review is required. MART review is required for anyone under the age of 65 seeking community Medicaid based on disability, requesting retro coverage or eligible for or enrolled in Medicare. 
2.2 Current State/Existing Functionality
Currently system evaluates a client for MAGI Medicaid, if the same client is applying for LTSS services, they are not evaluated for LTSS Medicaid and they remain in MAGI. Existing LTSS Workflow follows InRhodes Care/Waiver Codes. Katie Beckett Unit normally worked on a separate case. MART Review is required for LTSS Programs. A Level of Care Assessment is done by the Office of Medical Review. 
2.3 Business Process Impacts
Admin Worker, EOHHS Workers, Katie Beckett Unit, LTSS Workers, BHDDH Workers Medicaid Workers, HSRI administrators and HSRI workers need to understand the Medicaid hierarchy and process flow described in this document in order to understand the system determination results.
3 Design
3.1 Process Flow
Clients can apply for health insurance through the citizen portal exchange or a worker can register and process the application on behalf of the client through the worker portal. Once submitted, the application is evaluated to identify the appropriate coverage based on the client?s characteristics and needs. 
Below is a high-level process flow for a health insurance application in RIBridges.


*Please note that OPA rules illustrated in Section 3.17 are used to determine the eligibility based on the cascade of the hierarchy.  

StepTitleBusiness Rule1.Health insurance application submitted.User can submit health insurance application through multiple ways ? 
1. Client portal (HIX-only) for Health Insurance Application.
2. Self-service portal (DHS-2 application) for Complex Medicaid programs2.Application received in RIBridges.RIBridges can receive the application through multiple ways ? 
1. Submission through client portal. 
2. Submission through self-service portal. 
3. Submission through worker portal.
4. Received through conversion. 3.Application Date prior to Conversion Date.System evaluates if the application date is prior to the date of conversion. 
If Yes -Go to Step 4.
If No ? Go to Step 5.4.Run rules per DHS-2 hierarchy.If the application is received prior to the date of conversion, the system will only evaluate the application per the DHS-2 hierarchy of types of assistance. 5.Create group composition for MAGI evaluation. For applications received after the conversion date, the system runs the group composition rules to evaluate the application for MAGI-eligibility. 6.Run rules based on MAGI hierarchy.The system runs the non-financial and financial rules and then runs the verifications for MAGI and Private Insurance eligibility.  7.MAGI-eligible?System identifies if the application is MAGI-eligible. 
If No ? go to Step 8. 
If Yes ? go to Step 11. 8.EFP or TMA Eligible?The system runs the rules to identify if the applicant is Extended Family Planning (EFP) or Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) eligible based on current eligibility status. 
If Yes ? go to Step 11.
If No ? go to Step 9.9.QHP-eligible?The system runs the rules for QHP/APTC/CSR eligibility to identify if the applicant is eligible for QHP/APTC/CSR.
If Yes ? go to Step 11. 
If No ? go to Step 10. 10.Client identified as Exchange Ineligible. If the client fails meeting QHP eligibility requirements, they are identified as Exchange Ineligible. 11.Auto-authorize eligibility.If the applicant is MAGI-eligible, the system will auto-authorize the MAGI eligibility (This includes MAGI Medicaid and QHP). 
Go to Step 12. 12.Continue with Enrollment process.If client is MAGI-eligible or QHP-eligible, they will continue with the enrollment process. 13.Applicant continues with DHS-2.Applicant chooses to continue with the DHS-2 application. 
If Yes ? go to Step 14.
If No ? go to Step 15.14.Continue with DHS-2 application rules.The system will continue to process the DHS-2 application based on DHS-2 hierarchy 15.Complete application process.The system completes the eligibility determination for the particular application and completes the application process. 
Clients who are first-time applicants are evaluated first within the MAGI hierarchy of assistance. These forms of assistance provide coverage while evaluating only the income eligibility of the applicant group. It does not take into account resources and other assets.  If a client requires additional coverage, they are then evaluated for complex Medicaid. 

Existing clients, on the other hand, are evaluated within the complex Medicaid hierarchy of types of assistance right from the onset. In order to ensure their continued coverage, they do not go through the MAGI hierarchy initially. In the process of evaluating them through the complex Medicaid hierarchy, if MAGI eligibility is found to be the best fit for their needs and their income/resources, they will have access to MAGI Medicaid. 

When clients are eligible for MAGI Medicaid, they will be auto-authorized for MAGI Medicaid. Workers will not need to further authorize MAGI Medicaid. Users who have MAGI Medicaid or Private Insurance can further apply for complex Medicaid, where applicable. The system will allow users to have multiple overlapping types of assistance with one of them authorized at any point in time. Exceptions to this are further described in the particular sections within this document.

3.2 Type of Assistance
Narrative
A type of assistance code is assigned to each category of the programs evaluated for Health Insurance. Whenever a specific Medicaid Type is selected in ?Program Request? screen, the system shall evaluate the clients only specific to these programs. Whenever Medicaid Type is ?Blank? i.e., regular Medicaid application then they are evaluated for all programs except special categories.
1.	If an applicant is received through the SDX interface, the system will create an SSI Medicaid case only (Medicaid Type ? SSI). It will not evaluate the case for other types of assistance.
2.	If an applicant is created by the DCYF Unit for ?DCYF Medicaid?, the system will create an independent DCYF Medicaid case (Program Group ? DCYF). It will not evaluate the case for other types of assistance. 
3.	If an applicant is received through the Health Insurance application (HIX application through client portal), they will be evaluated through the MAGI flow only. They will be evaluated for MA- Chafee, MAGI Medicaid, Extended Family Planning (EFP) and Extended Medicaid (TMA). If they do not meet the eligibility requirements for these types of assistance, they will be evaluated for QHP.
4.	If an applicant is received through the DHS-2 application, they will be evaluated for MAGI Medicaid, Private Insurance programs and Complex Medicaid. They will be first evaluated through the MAGI eligibility determination point and then through Complex Medicaid (Comprehensive) eligibility determination point, based on their characteristics and application information.
5.	If an applicant is on complex Medicaid in InRhodes and has been created in RIBridges through conversion, they will be evaluated through the Complex Medicaid hierarchy only. They will be evaluated for MAGI categories only at the end. This is to ensure the MAGI eligibility is determined using Tax household information and Tax information is not available in InRhodes. 

Below describes the hierarchy of Types of Assistance both within the MAGI and Complex Medicaid hierarchies.

Note 1: Whenever client is determined eligible for EFP, they are still determined eligible for APTC/CSR/QHP. This is to ensure they have option to retain only EFP or EFP with QHP.
Note 2: A client who is eligible for APTC, CSR or PCPA will also be eligible for QHP. They will receive APTC, CSR or PCPA along with QHP.
Note 3: When a client changes from Medicaid to a EFP QHP determination the system should not create a Medicaid Termination Notice trigger as we will not send this notice in this situation.

Whenever worker completes the questions related to DHS-2 application (Non-MAGI specific questions), then are evaluated for the programs in the below mentioned order. If he/she fails the program requirements then system evaluates the client for the next program in the hierarchy. Additionally, if the client is pending eligibility due to following reasons, system will continue to evaluate the client for next program in the hierarchy.
> Clinical Determination is pending
> Disability determination is pending due to MART review.
Under following scenarios client should NOT be evaluated for MAGI. (Policy Ref: 42 CFR 435.603 (j))
> Client who is determined disabled by MART 
> SSI client
> SSI Protected population/SSI lookalike
Note:
> Converted Community Medicaid clients from InRhodes, who do not have Tax household relationship information in RIBridges, should continue to be eligible under Community Medicaid even though they meet MAGI Criteria. However, if their Community Medicaid is getting closed due to losing disability characteristics then they can be evaluated for MAGI Medicaid.
> A parent/caretaker receiving RSDI, enrolled in Part A and/or eligible for Part B can be eligible for MAGI and should be evaluated for this program.

Eligibility Determination Group (EDG)/ Filing Unit
An EDG is defined as members of a household whose needs, resources, incomes and deductions are considered in determining eligibility for benefits. The EDG includes members who are eligible, and may include members who are not eligible for or requesting benefits. As part of the Phase 2 design, EDGs will be created at the individual level and type of assistance level for each individual requesting coverage. Each EDG will have only one requesting member as the target and all the other members will be included or excluded from the EDG group as per existing functionality. For each individual requesting services, an independent EDG is created for the person per type of assistance. One person can potentially have multiple overlapping EDGs created, but only one authorized program. However, when a person?s coverage within a particular type of assistance is discontinued or reinstated, the EDG group for the person does not change. When a person moves from one type of assistance to another, a new EDG group is created for the person.  If a person were to close with one type of assistance at one point in time and then be eligible for the same type of assistance at a later point, the EDG number for the particular person and type of assistance will be the same for the two time periods. 

Similarly, if a case has multiple requesting members, the each EDG will have only one requesting member identified as the target while the other members will be identified as non-targets but part of the EDG group. There will be a unique EDG built for each member in the case. The other members will exist in each of the EDGs as non-target members. 

The Filing Unit consists of all members in the household identified by the following parameters ? 
* Members who are considered part of the Assistance Unit ? members requesting assistance and meets program eligibility criteria for the particular type of assistance. The Assistance Unit in each EDG will always be one (1) as the particular person will be considered as asking for assistance within that particular EDG. 

* Members who are considered part of the Certified Group ? members included in the household composition where they are a potential recipient of benefits. Each member of the Certified Group is further identified as ? 
o Eligible Adult: Adult whose income/resources and needs are considered. 
o Eligible Child: Child whose income/resources and needs are considered.

* Members who are considered part of the Financial Unit ? members whose income and resources are considered for the particular type of assistance. This includes Eligible, Other and Disqualified participants.
o Other Adult: Adult?s income/resources are considered but need is not considered. The person may not be considered because of program policy or because they are not seeking assistance.
o Other Child: Child?s income/resources are considered but need is not considered.
o Disqualified Adult: Adult?s income/resources are considered but adult is disqualified from participating in the program. 
o Disqualified Child: Child?s income/resources are considered but child is disqualified from participating in the program.

* Members who are excluded from Financial Unit. The member is excluded from the household composition because they do not meet the requirements of the program. 
o Excluded Adult: An adult excluded from the household composition as they do not meet program requirements. 
o Excluded Child: Child excluded from household composition as they do not meet program requirements. 
For new clients and cases created in RIBridges, the system will first evaluate the requesting individual for eligibility through the entire MAGI hierarchy. If the applicant has applied for Complex Medicaid, they are then taken through the cascading hierarchy of the Complex Medicaid hierarchy after being evaluated through the MAGI hierarchy first.

Please note ? prior to creating the EDG group and running eligibility, the eligibility process identifies is there is any critical piece of information missing. If any information is missing, eligibility will not run and a Missing Information screen is displayed. The user will not be able to proceed with running eligibility for the case until this information is present. 

If a client requesting assistance through a DHS-2 application has only an Estimated Date of Birth rather than an actual Date of Birth, an EDG will not be created and eligibility will not run. In the HIX flow, the eligibility process will display a message on the screen informing the user that the real date of birth is required. The eligibility process will also generate a Correspondence Trigger for the Estimated DOB notice to be generated. 
If the estimated DOB is in the DHS-2 flow, this will be included in the Missing Information screen prior to the eligibility run. Again, the eligibility process will generate a correspondence trigger for the Estimated DOB notice to be generated. 

Clients who are already enrolled in complex Medicaid or have been brought into RIBridges through conversion will be evaluated only in the Complex Medicaid hierarchy. They will not be evaluated through the MAGI hierarchy first. This ensures that their existing coverage continues. If they were to be evaluated through the MAGI flow first, they would potentially lose complex Medicaid coverage because they would be created as MAGI ? Pending because of lack of tax information needed to complete their MAGI Medicaid evaluation. 
Use Cases

Scenario 1: MAGI ? Approved and LTSS-Pending ? New Client
A childless adult (age 37) applies for health insurance coverage requests long term support services with an application date of 07/16/2015.  The applicant is new to RIBridges. They do not have a significant income. The client completes application registration for complex Medicaid. 

Upon submission of the application, the system runs eligibility determination and determines eligibility in the following manner: 

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIApproved07/01/201507/31/20151121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIApproved08/01/2015Ongoing1
Upon application registration, a task is generated for the LTSS worker regarding the potential LTSS-eligible case. When the worker initiates the Level of Care Assessment and runs the eligibility determination again, the following eligibility results will be created:

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIApproved07/01/201507/31/20151121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIApproved08/01/2015Ongoing1121002Albert Ford 37MMAGI ?

If the Level of Care Assessment is authorized on 09/10/2015, the eligibility is retroactively set as authorized and the MAGI eligibility will be closed. The eligibility determination will be displayed in the following manner:

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIClosed07/01/201507/31/20151121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIClosed08/01/201508/31/20151121001Albert Ford 37MMAGIClosed09/01/201509/30/20151121002Albert Ford 37MMAGI ?

For clients in converted cases, an EDG is built for each individual with the client requesting for services identified as the ?target? individual in the EDG. When eligibility is re-run for the case in RIBridges, the eligibility determination is identified at the EDG level for each program.  The converted individuals will first be evaluated for health insurance based on DHS-2 flow. They will not be evaluated in the MAGI flow if they do not have tax information submitted. If they are determined to be potentially MAGI-eligible, they will be sent an R-DOC requesting this information. 

Scenario #2: Converted clients with disability determined in InRhodes prior to conversion
A family of two (2) in InRhodes with coverage for Medicaid established in InRhodes prior to conversion. The client applies through the DHS-2 application and meets the disability requirements. The eligibility in InRhodes had been established on 03/01/2015. The conversion date is 07/01/2015.

When the eligibility is run in RIBridges, the eligibility determination is determined in the following hierarchy for both the family members ?
1. LTSS - MAGI
2. LTSS ? Low Income for Aged+Disabled
3. LTSS ? Special Income
4. LTSS ? HCBS Waiver
5. LTSS - Medically Needy
6. AB ? Blind
7. AD ? Low
8. ABD ? Med
9. MA ? MAGI
Based on the information for the two participants, the eligibility for the clients are built in the following manner:

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121001Thomas Ford 45MAD ? LowApproved07/01/201507/31/20152121001Thomas Ford 45MAD ?

However, because InRhodes does not have tax information for the client, they are determined as MAGI ? Pending. An R-DOC will be sent to the client asking them for tax information. 


Scenario #3: Existing InRhodes clients receiving LTSS with new person added in RIBridges
A family of two (2) in InRhodes with coverage for Medicaid established in InRhodes prior to conversion. The client applies through the DHS-2 application and meets the disability requirements. The eligibility in InRhodes had been established on 03/01/2015. The conversion date is 07/01/2015.  A new person is added to the family on 07/10/2015. 

When the eligibility is run in RIBridges, the eligibility determination is determined in the following hierarchy for the two existing family members in the following order ?
> LTSS ? SSI
> LTSS ? Low Income for Aged+Disabled
> LTSS ? Special Income
> LTSS ? HCBS Waiver
> LTSS-Medically Needy
> ABD ? Blind
> AD ? Low
> ABD ? Med
> MA ? MAGI
For the new person added directly in RIBridges, the following hierarchy will be used to determine their eligibility ? 

1. MA ? Chafee
2. MA ? MAGI
3. MA ? EFP
4. QHP
5. APTC
6. CSR
7. LTSS ? Cat (MAGI)
8. LTSS ? Med (MAGI)
Based on the information for the participants, the eligibility for the clients are built in the following manner:

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121001Thomas FordAD ? LowApproved07/01/201507/31/20152121001Thomas FordAD ?

However, because InRhodes does not have tax information for the client, they are determined as MAGI ? Pending. An R-DOC will be sent to the client asking them for tax information. 

Scenario #4: Converted clients who apply for benefits only in RIBridges
A family of two (2) existed in InRhodes with a SNAP eligibility. They are converted into RiBridges as an existing InRhodes client. They apply for health coverage (DHS-2) after the conversion date. One person has applied for LTSS. 

As the person did not have coverage prior to conversion, they will be considered as new clients in RIBridges. They will first be evaluated in the MAGI flow and then in the DHS-2 flow, like all new clients are evaluated.  The family will be evaluated for health coverage based on the following hierarchy:
* MAGI 
* SSI and SSI lookalike
* LTSS - MAGI
* LTSS ? Low Income for Aged+Disabled
* LTSS ? Special Income
* LTSS ? HCBS Waiver
* LTSS-Medically Needy
* Community Medicaid
* MA ? Sherlock
* APTC
* PTC
* CSR
If the client is determined to be MAGI-eligible, they will have both a MAGI determination and a LTSS ? MAGI determination. The LTSS-MAGI determination will be pending the Level of Care assessment. The eligibility determination for the family will look like the following:

The Level of Care Assessment may have been initiated by the worker and with a Pending status. Even if it had not been initiated by the worker, the LTSS eligibility would be created in a Pending status because the user completes a DHS-2 application requesting for LTSS. 

The DHS worker has 90 days to complete the Level of Care Assessment. In this scenario, they complete the assessment within the timeframe and approve the level of care assessment. This is recorded on 09/02/2015. The worker then reruns the eligibility.

Scenario #5:  Client on QHP and MART review confirmed. 
A childless adult, Jonas Ford 34M, applies for health insurance with financial assistance on 07/02/2015.  They indicate that they have a disability.  They have self-employment income. They do not request long-term support services. The client is denied MAGI but approved for QHP. They choose to enroll into a plan and pays the premium for it as well. 

On submitting their DHS-2 application, the system will evaluate them, first in the MAGI flow and then in the DHS-2 flow. They will be evaluated in the following manner ? 
1. MA ? MAGI
2. APTC/CSR/QHP
3. ABD (all types)
4. MA - Sherlock
Upon running eligibility, the eligibility determination results look as follows:

The worker completes the MART review on 07/25/2015 and records the information in the system. They run the eligibility again.  The eligibility determination looks as follows:

In addition to this, a task is created to the Contact Center to refund the QHP premium amount as the approval was after the 23rd of the month but before the 1st of the following month. Further, an 834 transaction is triggered to cancel their enrollment from the QHP provider. A transaction is sent to NFP to cancel their enrolment. 

Medicaid Eligibility Start and End Date

Medicaid Eligibility Start Date is based on the Application Date or the Change Reporting Date. If the client asks for retro-active coverage prior to the Application Date, eligibility benefit periods will be computed for the retro-period for traditional Medicaid. The few exceptions for when an eligibility start date is established as not the 1st of the month are as following:
* When there is timely reporting of a newborn. 
* Emergency Medicaid coverage start date can be any day of the month.
* Spend down met date can be any day of the month.
The Eligibility End Date is based on the last date of the month on which the eligibility ends, unless the person is reported as deceased. 

Intake Mode: In the Intake mode, the Medicaid Eligibility Start Date for a new application is identified as the 1st of the month associated with the Application Date. When eligibility determination is run, the benefit periods identified are for the current month and the following month. The eligibility determination for the following month is identified as an ongoing eligibility benefit period. 

The Eligibility Determination Summary will look as the following: 

Filing Unit #ParticipantTOABenefit StatusBenefit StartBenefit EndFinancial Unit121002Maggie FordMAGIApproved07/01/201507/31/20153121002Maggie FordMAGIApproved08/01/2015Ongoing3

Change Reporting Mode:  If a client were to report a change in information that results in eligibility change, the Medicaid Eligibility Start Date for the will be the 1st of the month when the eligibility change is effective. The previous aid category is expected to end on the last date of the month before the new aid category result starts. This ensures continual coverage for the client. 

Some of the reasons why a client may report a change include: 

Reason for ChangeEligibility Start/End Date ? Timely Reporting Eligibility Start/End Date ? Untimely ReportingAdd a memberStart Date - 1st of reporting monthStart Date - 1st of reporting monthMember is deceasedEnd Date - Date of DeathEnd Date ? Date of DeathNewborn Added ?

Batch Mode:   Medicaid eligibility is automatically created for the following month within the certification period through a monthly batch process.  The batch process automatically end dates the prior month?s eligibility with the last date of the month. It creates a new ongoing eligibility row for the following month with the start date as the 1st of the month. 

Renewal Mode:   Medicaid eligibility will be renewed under the following circumstances ? 
* The worker receives and enters a renewal package and runs eligibility.
* The system passively renews eligibility for cases/types of assistance.
For both forms of renewal, the Eligibility Start Date is set determined to be from the 1st of the month following the renewal date.  For cases that are passively renewed, the system will use external data sources to verify information prior to determining the eligibility status. 

More details regarding the renewal and redetermination process is outlined in the Renewals and Redetermination Design Document. 

Closure of Overdue Verifications (Standard of Promptness):   Medicaid that is Pending due to verifications will be closed automatically by the same batch the processes all overdue verifications. The batch identifies which program has overdue verifications and inserts a trigger for the eligibility process to run. The eligibility Mass Update process invokes the eligibility rules to proceed with determining the eligibility for the program, based on the overdue verification point. 
Adverse Action
The 15th of the month is the negative action date for all the Medicaid programs. 
* Whenever eligibility is determined on or before the 15th of the month then the system shall determine eligibility up to future month and negative action shall be taken effective next month.
* Whenever eligibility is determined after the 15th of the month then the system shall determine eligibility up to next-to-next month and negative action shall be taken effective next-to-next month.
* The Adverse action rules mainly apply to negative scenarios such as Removal of a Member, Loss of Employment, Loss of Coverage etc.
Negative action or adverse action notice (1605 notice) shall be given upon following circumstances:
> Medicaid is getting closed/terminated. 
a. Whenever aid category code changes, the system shall not provide adverse action notice or adequate advance notice.
b. An adverse action notice or adequate advance notice is not sent if eligibility changes between types of assistance within a particular program group. It is sent only when the client?s eligibility changes from program group to program group.
c. Additionally, when Medicaid is terminated completely and the user moves to private insurance or is considered Exchange Ineligible, the system will create a trigger to generate the Medicaid Termination Notice (COR-ENR-05) to be sent to the client. 
> Sherlock Premium increased or decreased (1605 notice).
> Cost of Care for LTSS service is increased or decreased (1605 notice).
3.4 Chafee Kids Medicaid
An applicant is evaluated for Chafee Kids Medicaid within the initial MAGI Medicaid evaluation flow. If a person is determined as Chafee ? Medicaid eligible, they will not be considered for any further Medicaid eligibility. 

When a client ages out of the Chafee Medicaid program, they will be automatically notified of their upcoming ineligibility. They will be eligible to apply for assistance through the standard RIBridges portal.  

Chafee Kids Group Composition
No changes are expected in the Group Composition for Chafee Kids Medicaid. Instead of being part of just the Complex Medicaid hierarchy, MA ? Chafee will be considered within the MAGI hierarchy flow as well.

?	Should be 18 years or older at the time of application 
?	And be less than the age of 26 at the time of application
?	And received Adoption Subsidy from Rhode Island on their 18th birthday

Further details on the verification process and the rules for each data points can be found in 03.18-P2-Process Doc-Eligibility-Automation of Verification for Complex Medicaid. 
Chafee Medicaid ? Renewals
A Chafee - Medicaid client does not have to go through a renewal process on a periodic basis.  Their eligibility is passively renewed until their 26th birthday.  

If a client receiving Chafee Medicaid moves out of state, they will be disenrolled from Medicaid effective the end of current month or the month they left the state.  Information on the age-out process can be found in 03.21-P2-Process Doc-Eligibility-Age Out Batch.

Chafee Kids ? Security
No security is expected to be impacted with this change.

3.5 Katie Beckett Medicaid

A person is considered eligible for Katie Beckett Medicaid if they are under the age of 19 and have an impairment that is severe enough to put a significant burden on one?s ability to engage in age-appropriate activities according to the SSA Rules and Regulations. They also require a level of care that is typically provided in a hospital, nursing facility or an Intermediate Care Facility. An applicant is evaluated for Katie Beckett Medicaid as part of the complex Medicaid (DHS-2) workflow.  

When a client ages out of the Katie Beckett Medicaid program, they will be automatically notified of their upcoming ineligibility. They will be eligible to apply for assistance with the DHS-2 application to be re-evaluated through the Medicaid Hierarchy cascade to identify the highest benefit they are now eligible for.

When an applicant or parent submits a health insurance application, they are initially evaluated within the MAGI Medicaid workflow for the target applicant. If the applicant is denied MAGI, they are given the option to enroll in private insurance as long as them meet the non-financial requirements for private insurance. Katie Beckett will no longer be a separate case. They will be part of the same Medicaid Account, however they will have DHS-2 application submitted. Existing Katie Beckett cases in InRhodes are standalone cases. They will continue to be a separate case. They will be flagged with Medicaid Type as ?Katie Beckett?. However this option cannot be selected by Admin User/Worker.  Whenever Application Type is ?Katie Beckett? they will be evaluated only for Katie Beckett Medicaid. 

If an applicant indicates that they have a disability and require long term support services, they are given the option to continue with a DHS-2 application to be evaluated for Katie Beckett (LTSS) Medicaid. If the applicant chooses to continue with a DHS-2 application and completes the application registration, (or a DHS-2 application is directly created in the worker portal), the following decisions occur:
* Has the applicant completed a DHS-2 application
* Is the applicant is under the age of 19
* Has the applicant been denied MAGI-Medicaid (This rule is not applicable for Converted Katie Beckett Cases)
* Is the applicant requesting long term support services and indicated that they have a disability. 
If all the criteria above are met, a task is created for the Katie Beckett Unit to review the case for potential Katie Beckett eligibility. The Katie Beckett Unit can then initiate a Level of Care Assessment and a Disability Determination. When the DHS-2 application is submitted with a Pending Level of Care Assessment or a Pending Disability Determination, the system creates a Katie Beckett ? Pending eligibility that overlaps with the QHP eligibility. Once the Level of Care Assessment is authorized and the Disability Determination is authorized, the system will authorize the Katie Beckett eligibility back to the date of application. If the authorization occurs before the 23rd of the month, a trigger is created to close QHP and disenroll the client as of the end of the month. If the authorization is recorded on or after the 23rd of the month and prior to the 1st of the following month, a task is created to the Contact Center to refund the client for the QHP amount. A trigger is also created to close the QHP and disenroll the client as of the end of the month. The Katie Beckett eligibility is created as of the date of application. 




Katie Beckett Medicaid ? Group Composition

To be considered potentially eligible for Katie Beckett Medicaid, an applicant should meet the following criteria:

* Should be less than 19 years of age at the time of application and
* Should indicate that they require assistance for daily activities and long-term care services in the home or community to help with daily activities and
* Denied MAGI Medicaid (This rule is not applicable for Converted cases, For converted cases the Medicaid Type should be ?Katie Beckett?)  and
* Has a Level of Care in a Pending Status or Approved.[ If the client doesn?t meet the LOC requirement, a denial notice should be sent to client indicating the reason]

Katie Beckett Medicaid ? Non-Financial

Potentially Katie Beckett Medicaid applicants are evaluated on the following non-financial eligibility criteria:

* Must be a resident of Rhode Island and
* Must be a citizen of the United States or a lawfully present non-citizen and
* Must not be incarcerated and
* Must provide a valid SSN and
* Must report access to public or non-public MEC and 
* Must have a Katie Beckett Review and
* Must have a Level of Care Determination.
Level of Care Overall Process

A Level of Care Assessment is initiated for a Katie Beckett or Long-Term Services and Support case where a client is requesting long term support services and the EOHHS worker initiates a level of care assessment. The process flow describes how the level of care assessment status determines the case that is built for the client. 




The Katie Beckett eligibility is considered as ?Pending? under the following conditions ? 
* Assessment Type is Katie Beckett and
* Assessment Status is Pending and
* Assessment Status Date is null and 
* There is no Care Level indicated (Care Level is null) and
* Katie Beckett review is null or pending.

The Katie Beckett eligibility is considered as ?Approved? when ? 
* Assessment Type is Katie Beckett and
* Assessment Status is Approved and
* Assessment Status Date is not null and
* The Care Level is ICF-ID, Hospital or Nursing Home
* Care Start Date is equal to or greater than application begin date and 
* Care End Date is null or greater than Care Start Date and
* Katie Beckett review is approved.

The Katie Beckett eligibility is ?Denied? when ? 
* Assessment Type is Katie Beckett and
* Assessment Status is Denied and 
* Assessment Status Date is not null.
* If a Level of Care Assessment or 
* Katie Beckett review is Denied. 
The Katie Beckett ? Pending case will be closed as of the date of assessment with an eligibility status of ?Denied?.  The system will also send the client an Adverse Action Notice to the client informing them of the denial of Katie Beckett eligibility.  The status of the notice is updated to ?Printed? to ensure that there are no further notifications sent to the applicant. The QHP eligibility for the individual will continue as the ongoing case, based on the successful completion of QHP eligibility rules. 
If a Katie Beckett child ages out of the eligibility criteria, and the Level of Care End Date is after the age-out date, a trigger is created to automatically evaluate the client through the Medicaid Hierarchy cascade to determine the highest benefit that they would be eligible for. 

If the Level of Care End Date is prior to the redetermination date for the Katie Beckett case, the system will create a task for the Katie Beckett Unit to review and renew the Level of Care Assessment. This task will be created 90 days before the End Date of the Level of Care Assessment. 

Katie Beckett Medicaid ?Financial

There are no expected changes in the financial eligibility as part of this change request for Katie Beckett eligibility. Only the child?s income (earned and unearned) and resources are considered for Katie Beckett determination. The income and resources of the parents are not considered for the child?s Katie Beckett financial eligibility.
Katie Beckett Medicaid ? Verifications

For Katie Beckett eligibility, the following data points have to be verified as part of the eligibility Verifications process.

Data Point(s)Verified for the Type of Assistance?NameYesDate of BirthYesSSNYesCitizenshipYesImmigration StatusYesImmigration ? 5 Year Bar MetYesIncarceration StatusYesDeceased IndicatorYesCurrent Income (Title II)YesCurrent Income (Wages)YesESI MECNoNon-Employer Sponsored Insurance (ESI) Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)NoRental IncomeYesOther unearned IncomeYesSelf-Employment IncomeYesAssets/ResourcesYesResource TransferYes
If all the data points for an applicant are verified through external data sources, they are automatically authorized for Katie Beckett Medicaid.  The worker does not have to do a manual authorization of this case. 


Katie Beckett Medicaid ? Renewals

Katie Beckett cases will need to be renewed annually. The Level of Care Assessment may be applicable for a longer period of time and may not require renewal. However, as part of the renewal process, services may need to be re-authorized when eligibility is re-determined. 

All data points will not need to be re-verified as part of the renewal process. The particular data points that need to be re-verified are specified in 03.19-P2-Process Doc-Eligibility-Passive Renewal.

Katie Beckett Medicaid ? Screens and Tables
In order to process an application for Katie Beckett eligibility, the applicant needs to indicate their need for long term services through the Special Circumstances screen. This screen is accessed as part of the MAGI flow within the application. 

If the applicant selects to continue with the DHS application after indicating that they require LTSS services, they will be guided to the Level of Care screens.

In particular, in the Special Circumstances screen, the highlighted questions lead to a person being evaluated as Katie Beckett:



If the person answers ?Yes? to the question saying that the applicant needs long-term care services then, the Level of Care screens are queued up within the Non-Financial section of the DHS-2 application flow. The user is expected to access this information and enter the level of care as ?Pending? during the clinical evaluation.

  


The Level of Care screens have been added to the Non-Financial workflow to capture the Level of Care information. Details of these screens are provided in the section on Design Artifacts Inserted. 


Katie Beckett ? Tasks/Alerts/Mass Updates

* The following tasks will be created for Katie Beckett eligibility:

o For a new DHS-2 Medicaid application, after eligibility determination for MAGI programs, if the client is determined potentially eligible for Katie Beckett (LTSS) Medicaid, then a  task is created to the Katie Beckett Unit to evaluate the case. 

o System will send out Katie Beckett disability determination forms, 90 days prior to its periodic review date. All cases, doesn?t need to be periodically reviewed.

o System will send out a Task to Katie Beckett Unit to initiate the Level of Care review for the clients, whose level of care needs to be reviewed in the next 90 days.

o Katie Beckett unit will receive a task, whenever child?s individual or income/resource information is updated by other public assistance program worker or contact center worker. This is to review the new information reported and take appropriate actions.

* The following Mass Updates Triggers will be created for Katie Beckett eligibility:

o Trigger is created to run eligibility, if the Katie Beckett determination review form is not received from client within 45 days from the sent date.
o Trigger is created to run eligibility, if the Katie Beckett review is not completed within 90 days from the review initiated date or form sent date. 
Katie Beckett ? Security

* LTSS Unit ? Read-Write access
* BHDDH ? Read-Write access
* All other users who have read access to the data collection screens will have read-only access to the Level of Care screens. 

Age-Out Batch
The changes to the age-out batch for the Katie Beckett eligibility are detailed in 03.21-P2-Process Doc-Eligibility-Age Out Batch.

MMIS Interface
There are no specific changes related to MMIS Interfaces for Katie Beckett Medicaid.

Katie Beckett ? Notices

The existing Katei Beckett notices will not be affected by the changes reflected here.  

3.6 SSI Medicaid

SSI Medicaid information is determined by and typically received from the Social Security Administration. This is received through the State Data Exchange (SDX) interface.  Cases are automatically opened and updated for clients in RIBridges based on the information received from the SSI batch. 

Clients can also apply for SSI Medicaid by taking their qualifying SSI information to a DHS office. In this instance, a worker opens an SSI Medicaid case using the authorizing information. If a client is applying for SSI Medicaid only, there is no financial or resource eligibility determination.  It is expected that this information is further confirmed through the SDX interface during the following run. 

Clients receiving SSI can also apply for and receive LTSS services. If they request for long term care assistance, they will be evaluated for LTSS based on the LTSS resource eligibility and Level of Care Assessment criteria. 

SSI Medicaid ? Group Composition

A client receiving SSI-Medicaid will have an individual EDG built for their SSI type of assistance.  An SSI Medicaid case will, most often, be created by the information received via the SDX interface.  If the client is identified as receiving SSI income, the client will be considered eligible for SSI ? Medicaid type of assistance.  If the person does not receive SSI income, they will be considered eligible for SSI ? 1619B type of assistance. 

If a person eligible for SSI Medicaid is also applying for long term support services, the Group Composition rules for LTSS services will define the SSI ? LTSS Medicaid Group Composition. The group composition rules for LTSS clients are further defined in the LTSS section of this document.

SSI Ex-Parte/Termination Process

When a client no longer receives SSI income or are determined as closed for the SSI-1619B Medicaid, they will no longer be eligible for SSI Medicaid. The client will need to be ex-parte reviewed and then closed out of SSI Medicaid following the appropriate timeframes and procedures. The ex-parte process is initiated by a closure or termination received from SSA through the SDX batch. Below diagram depicts is the system process flow and details outlining the ex-parte process for terminating a client from SSI Medicaid.

When a client is ex-parte reviewed from SSI Medicaid and also receives LTSS, the termination notice they receive will include information on re-applying for LTSS Medicaid through the system. 

Below is the high-level process flow for terminating SSI Medicaid. The details of the termination codes that require the ex-parte process and those that can be closed without an ex-parte are included in the Appendix.



The Payment Status Codes from the SDX interface indicates if an SSI client needs to be terminated from SSI-Medicaid in the system. The Payment Status Codes indicates if an ex-parte process is needed prior to terminating the SSI-Medicaid or if it can be terminated without an ex-parte process. If the code indicates that a client can be terminated without an ex-parte process, the SSI- Medicaid is closed as of the last day of the month that the SSI transaction is received.  If the client should receive an ex-parte notice regarding the termination of their SSI-Medicaid, the SDX batch will trigger the Adverse Action Notice to provide the client with enough time to apply for regular Medicaid prior to the SSI-Medicaid closure. Once the client applies for Medicaid, the system will trigger the closure for the SSI-Medicaid while evaluating the application for Medicaid eligibility. If the client has a family case, they can be added to the existing family case as a requesting member and can be considered for eligibility when the eligibility is re-run for the case. The SSI case will be closed out. 

SSI Medicaid ? Non-Financial

There are no expected changes in the Non-Financial eligibility as part of this change request for SSI eligibility. 

If an SSI Medicaid client is also requesting for Long Term Support Services, they will be evaluated based on the LTSS criteria specific for long term services. Below is the list of LTSS non-financial criteria that need to be evaluated for SSI ? LTSS clients.  

Non-Fin InformationApplicable for SSI ? LTSS?Applicable for LTSS?Applicable for Sherlock LTSS?CitizenshipNoYesYesNon-Citizen StatusNoYesYesRhode Island ResidencyYesYesYesSSNNoYesYesIncarcerationYesYesYesDisabilityNoYesYesLevel of CareYesYesYesThird Party CoverageNoYesYesPremium Non-Payment SanctionNoNoYes
As information regarding citizenship, non-citizen status, and disability are already verified by SSI prior to a person receiving MA ? SSI, they will not need to be re-evaluated within RIBridges. The only data points that need to be triggered by the non-financial rules are based on the ones that are unique to LTSS like Level of Care assessment. 

SSI Medicaid ? Financial

There are no expected changes in the financial eligibility as part of this change request for SSI eligibility.

If an SSI Medicaid client also requesting for Long Term Support Services, they will be evaluated based on LTSS criteria for Resource eligibility. This is further defined in the Long Terms Support Services section of this document.  

SSI Medicaid ? Verifications

There are no expected changes in the verifications process for SSI Medicaid. If a client applies for SSI Medicaid from the DHS office, they will be subject to the verifications listed below. If a client also applies for LTSS, they will be subject to LTSS verifications process, where applicable.  Detailed specifications of the verifications process is outlined in the Verifications Design Document. 

Data Point(s)Verified for the Type of Assistance?NameNoDate of BirthNoSSNNoCitizenshipNoImmigration StatusNoImmigration ? 5 Year Bar MetNoIncarceration StatusNoDeceased IndicatorNoCurrent Income (Title II)NoCurrent Income (Wages)NoESI MECNoNon-Employer Sponsored Insurance (ESI) Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)No

There are no expected impacts on SSI-Medicaid renewals process as part of this change request. 

SSI Medicaid ? Screens and Tables
There are no expected changes to screens and tables that will impact SSI-Medicaid as part of this change request. 

SSI Medicaid ? Tasks/Alerts/Mass Updates
The following new tasks will be generated for SSI Medicaid 

1. Address Update
If an address is updated through SNAP (or another DHS program), a task is created to the SSI Unit to update the mailing address in UHIP.  
The worker will be able to update the Mailing Address for the person to ensure that the State SSI payments and cards go to the correct address. They will need to coordinate with SSA to update the Physical Address of the person. 

2. Address Verification
If the payment status code received from SDX is N54 (Unable to locate participant) or S06 (Suspended ? Recipient?s address unknown), a task is generated to identify if the address of the client can be found through any other DHS program in the system.

3. Verification of Death
If the payment status code received from SDX is S01 (Suspension of payment due to report of death by Treasure or potential automated death case), a task is created to the SSI Unit to review the death information received. 
The SSI Unit will initiate the R-DOC and closure of the SSI-Medicaid if the death information is confirmed.

4. Exparte Review Required
If the payment status code received from SDX identifies the case as ex-parte required, a task is created to the Supervisor queue requiring the supervisor to review the case and authorize closure. 
SSI Medicaid ? Security
There are no expected changes to security as part of this change request that impacts SSI Medicaid. 

SSI Medicaid ? Batches/Interfaces
The following batches/interfaces will be impacted by this change request:
SDX Interface
Based on the payment status code, the SDX interface creates triggers to close the SSI-Medicaid case or generate an ex-parte notice to the client.  The case is closed based on the Denial Date received from the interface or at the end of month for which the interface is received. 

For termination reasons that require an ex-parte notice, the SDX interface only creates the trigger to generate the notice to the client. 

Below is the list of Termination Codes and how they should be treated for the ex-parte process:

MMIS Interface
The MMIS 4B Transaction will be sent to MMIS system to close SSI client?s SSI Medicaid based on the closure information received through SDX (SSA) interface.
SSI Medicaid ? Notices
There are no expected changes to notices with this change request that impacts SSI Medicaid.

3.7 SSI Lookalikes
SSI Lookalikes cases are eligible for Medicaid even though they are not SSI-eligible based on the income criteria. They lose SSI Medicaid eligibility due to increases in SSI income based on specific factors like COLA increases or actuarial changes. These cases are received through the State Data Exchange (SDX) interface and are automatically opened and updated for clients in RIBridges based on the information received from the SSI batch. 

Clients can also apply for SSI Lookalike Medicaid by taking their qualifying SSI information to a DHS office. In this instance, a worker opens an SSI Medicaid case using the authorizing information. It is expected that this information is further confirmed through the SDX interface during the following run. 

Clients receiving SSI Lookalikes are considered disabled as they are receiving or have received SSI or RSDI ? Disability benefits.  They would require a MART Review only if they do not receive or have never received SSI or RSDI-Disability benefits.

Clients receiving some SSI Lookalike types of Medicaid can also apply for and receive LTSS services. If they request for long term care assistance, they will be evaluated for LTSS based on the LTSS resource eligibility and Level of Care Assessment criteria.  The following are the SSI Lookalike programs in RIBridges - 
> Pickle Amendment
> Disabled Adult Child
> SSI Inelig Actuar changes
> Protected Widow(er)
> Disabled Widow(er), Divorced Spouse	

Pickle Amendment
The Pickle Amendment protects low-income SSI recipients from losing benefits because of COLA increases in their SSI benefits. When a client receives both SSI and Medicaid because of their SSI income, they may lose Medicaid eligibility with a COLA increase in SSI or RSDI income. In this case, they are eligible through the Pickle Amendment and can use their original SSI income in determining continued Medicaid eligibility. 

Eligibility Requirements: 
In order to qualify for the Pickle Amendment, the client should ? 
1. Should have received SSI and RSDI income concurrently
2. Currently receiving RSDI income
3. Be closed to SSI because of a COLA increase in RSDI on or after April 1st, 1977
4. Be determined aged, blind or disabled by SSI
5. Have household resource value is less than or equal to $2000.
6. The person?s resource value is <= $3,000 if the person?s spouse is part of the financial unit
7. The person?s resource value is <= $2000 if the person?s spouse is not considered part of the financial unit

Disabled Adult Child
The Disabled Adult Child (DAC) SSI lookalike provides income for disabled adult children who would lose their SSI income due to increases in RSDI income with a COLA increase. The DAC-SSI category protects their SSI-Medicaid coverage by protecting their SSI-Medicaid status.  To be eligible for this status, a person should ? 
1. Be at least eighteen (18) years of age
2. Have disability onset date is before their 22nd birthday
3. Be denied SSI because of an increase in their RSDI due to COLA (denial reason code is due to increase in Child?s benefit (Title II-d).
4. Have lost SSI benefits only after July 1, 1987
For this group, the client applies for Medicaid through the DHS-2 form and passes all other requirements (residency, citizenship, enumeration etc). Their RSDI income is disregarded as countable income in identifying if they are SSI eligible.
SSI Inelig Actuar Changes
SSI and RSDI recipients who received disabled widow(ers) benefits prior to the age of 60 lost SSI benefits due to changes in the actuarial reduction formula used to calculate their benefits. This change in calculation resulted in increases in their RSDI income to above the SSI standard, causing them to lose SSI benefits. In order to protect this population, the COBRA of 1985 reinstituted the categorically eligible status for the applicants. 

Eligibility Requirements:
To be eligible under this coverage, the person should ? 
1. The person should have filed for Medicaid prior to July 1st, 1988 and
2. They have been eligible for disabled widow(er) benefits as part of RSDI (Title II) as of December 1983 and
3. They have received SSI benefits based on disability for January 1984 and
4. They have become ineligible for SSI benefits after the increase in RSDI payments due to changes in the reduction factor formula and
5. They continue to be eligible for RSDI Disabled Widow(er) benefits and
6. They would be eligible for SSI if the COLAs were disregarded as countable income.
7. All other conditions for SSI eligibility (except for RSDI income) should be met.

When determining if an applicant is categorically eligible for SSI ? Inelig Actuarial Changes, the RSDI income of the client is not considered as part of the income calculations. 
If a person does not meet other eligibility requirements, their RSDI income is used in determining if they are Medically Needy.
Protected Widow(ers) Age 60 ? 65
This SSI category provides disabled widow(ers) between the age of 60 and 65 who lose SSI benefits because of their entitlement to Protected Widow(er) benefits or a combination of Protected Widow(er) and RSDI benefits. Further, these applicants are entitled to Title II benefits and are not yet Medicare eligible. 

Eligibility Requirements:
* The person loses SSI eligibility due to entitlement to widowers benefits and
* They are greater or equal to 60 years old and less than the age of 65 and
* They are currently receiving RSDI benefits and
* They are not entitled to Medicare and
* They have a disability determination per SSA
The person?s RSDI income is disregarded until the person reaches 65 or becomes Medicare eligible. If they are close to their 65th birthday, the redetermination is done one month prior to the client reaching the age of 65.  If the client is not categorically needy, they will be evaluated for Medically Needy eligibility. All income will be included in determining medically needy eligibility.

Disabled Widow(ers), Divorced Spouse
The Disabled Widow(er)/Divorced Spouse coverage group consists of disabled widow(ers) and disabled surviving spouses who lose SSI benefits or State Supplement due to the receipt of Title II Disabled Widow(er) benefits. For Medicaid purposes, these clients are deemed SSI eligible until they can receive Medicare.

Eligibility Requirements:
A person is considered eligibility for, Divorced Spouse if ? 
* They currently receive RSDI benefits and 
* Their SSI was denied because of the Disabled Widower (RSDI Survivor) benefits they receive and 
* They do not receive Medicare and
* They are not entitled to receive Medicare 

3.8 Emergency Medicaid (MAGI and ABD)
Emergency Medicaid helps cover emergency health coverage for expenses that have already occurred. This includes in-patient hospital services and emergency hospital services.  It is provided to clients who meet all MAGI or ABD Medicaid criteria except the Citizenship/Non-Citizen requirements.   If a person is not eligible for MAGI or ABD Medicaid only because they do not meet the Citizenship/Non-Citizen requirements, they can potentially be eligible for Emergency Medicaid.  The system will not build retro-QHP coverage for the individual requesting coverage through Emergency Medicaid.  If a person receives Emergency ? ABD coverage, they either meet the age criteria for Aged (above the age of 65 years) or they are considered disabled through a MART review or have SSI/RSDI-Disability.

Emergency Medicaid is provided only for a specific period of time in the past.  The client indicates the start and end dates of their emergency in the ?Alien? screen in the application.  The Emergency Medicaid period is identified from the start and end date of the emergency indicated. If the emergency spans multiple months, multiple eligibility rows are created with a Start Date for the first eligibility period identified as the start date of the emergency and the End Date of the last eligibility period identified as the end date of emergency indicated. The Emergency period cannot span more than 90 days at a time. Ongoing approved eligibility is not created for Emergency Medicaid. 
Note: Emergency Medicaid is always for the past period. The worker needs to enter the application date and request date as past month for the Emergency Medicaid to be approved.  The application date should reflect the emergency period that is being covered. Emergency Medicaid for ABD Group needs to be built with Medically Needy Group and client should have Medical expenses reported. 


Scenario #1:   An applicant applies for health insurance coverage. They indicate that they are a non-citizen and they have had a medical emergency. The start date of the medical emergency is 06/03/2015 and the end date of the medical emergency is 06/17/2015.  They apply for assistance on 06/20/2015.  The user would need to enter the Application Date as the Start Date of the emergency period, similar to current practice.

3.9 MA ? Transitional Medicaid (MA-XMA)
Transitional Medicaid, or Extended Medicaid, is provided to families (parents) who are transitioning from welfare to work.  It covers families who are participating in RI Works and families who forego cash assistance and have an income up to 110% of FPL at the time of eligibility determination.  Families will be eligible for Extended Medicaid for up to twelve (12) months if they were to potentially lose health coverage due to one of the following reasons:

* Employment
* Increase in wages
* Increase in hours worked
A family can be approved for a period of six (6) months following their loss of coverage. At the end of six month period, the client has to provide an earned income report and necessary child care expenses. At this point, the client can be evaluated for the remaining six months of Extended Medicaid. The family can be eligible for Extended Medicaid again during their lifetime, if they were to come back into RIWorks. 

?Whenever TMA switch is turned off, system should evaluate them only for four month TMA period. If the client is already receiving TMA, then TMA should be denied beyond four months period. However, system needs to be provide adverse action notice.?
Extended/Transitional Medicaid ? Group Composition

There is no change in the group composition for Extended Medicaid group composition. The group composition is created with the following characteristics:

* Family has a dependent child living at home who is less than 18 years old or
* Family has a dependent child between age 18 and 19 who is enrolled in full-time school or vocational/technical training and is expected to finish the program before or on their 19th birthday and 
* Family is not eligible for other forms of Medicaid coverage and 
* Family loses Medicaid coverage due to one of the following reasons:
o Employment or
o Increase in wages or
o Increase in hours
The family members who will be included as part of the group composition include:

* Individuals who are living in the household and who were included in determining original Medicaid eligibility
* Individuals who would be included in determining Medicaid eligibility if the family were Medicaid eligible going forward. 
o If a new person were to be included in the household after the expiration of the Medicaid eligibility, this person will be included in assessing eligibility for Extended Medicaid as well. 
Initial Criteria for Extending Medicaid
At the time a family becomes ineligible for Section 1931 Medicaid benefits, the Medicaid agency must verify and confirm, whether:
1. The Family meets the all the requirements of 1931 Family Medicaid except Financial Eligibility.
2. 1931 Family Medicaid   is lost due to earnings increase or employment or employment hours increase.
Loss of Benefits Due to Employment
A required element for eligibility to receive extended Medicaid is employment of a parent / caretaker or other member(s) of the family whose earned income contributes to the family's loss of eligibility for Section 1931 Medicaid. Often employment linked with other changes, such as a parent returning to the home or a child turning eighteen, may combine to cause the loss of eligibility. While there must be a relationship between earned income and the loss of eligibility for Section 1931 Medicaid to qualify for extended Medicaid, the advent or increase in earned income need not be the only factor causing the loss.
Individuals Eligible to be Included
The first month of extended Medicaid is the first full or partial month in which the family loses eligibility for Medicaid health care coverage under Section 1931, but only in those instances in which eligibility under any other Medicaid coverage group is unavailable. If the family is eligible for Medicaid State Plan or HCBS coverage, extended Medicaid will be denied. Extended Medicaid is provided to those individuals: 
? who are living in the household, and whose needs and income were included in determining Section 1931 eligibility of the assistance unit at the time such benefits were discontinued; 
?  whose needs and income would be taken into account in determining Section 1931 Medicaid eligibility of the assistance unit if the family were applying for either of these programs in the current month
Initial Receipt of Extended Medicaid
Extended Medicaid continues throughout the first seven months following the loss of Section 1931 Medicaid eligibility unless: 
? No age-appropriate child is living in the family; 
? The parent / caretaker refuses to apply for health coverage offered by the employer. 
When it is determined that a family no longer has a child who meets the age requirements living in the home, Medicaid for all family members ends the last day of the month in which the family no longer includes such child.
Continuing Receipt of Extended Medicaid
To continue to receive the remaining months of extended Medicaid, up to the limit of the full twelve months of the transitional medical program, families must: 
? Include a child who meets the age requirement living in the household; and 
?  Timely file the earned income report when due in the seventh (7th) month; and 
?  Pass the 185% FPL earned income test; and 
?  Pass the parent / caretaker employment test. Additionally, an employed parent / caretaker must enroll in an employment-related health plan, if such plan is offered.
Submitting the Earned Income Report 
The extended Medicaid earned income reports are: 
? an accounting of the family's total gross earned income and a parent / caretaker?s necessary child care expenses for month six (6) of extended benefits; 
?  Due by the 5th day of month six (6) respectively of extended benefits. On the 15th of each month, a reporting form is sent to any family who has reached month six (6) of extended Medicaid. Such a family must report the required income and necessary child care information by the 5th day of the following month. 
? On the 7th day of each month, a reminder notice is sent to all extended Medicaid cases scheduled to report in the month. This is to encourage compliance by any family that has neglected to return the report by the due date (5th of the month)
Extended/Transitional Medicaid ? Non-Financial
There are no changes to non-financial requirements for Extended/Transitional Medicaid as part of these changes. It follows MAGI rules.

Extended/Transitional Medicaid ? Financial
There is no financial check for the Initial eligibility up to six (6) months. Once the client filed the earned income reporting then their countable income should up within 185% FPL. Otherwise, they are not eligible for TMA for the remaining six (6) months.

There is no post-eligibility verification for Extended Medicaid. 

Extended/Transitional Medicaid ? Renewals
Extended Medicaid cases will come for Interim renewal six (6) months after it is created. The case can be created for another six (6) months to extend the total eligibility period to twelve (12) months. An earned income report is required before the eligibility is renewed for the following six (6) months. If a client does not submit an Earned Income Report within the 6th month of TMA, the client?s coverage through this TOA will be terminated.

3.10 Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) Medicaid

Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) provide clients with assistance for self-care daily activities that they may not be able to perform for a short period of time or on an ongoing basis. It provides assistance to people with activities of daily living like eating, preparing meals, and housekeeping. LTSS can be delivered in institutional settings and within a home/community based setting as well. LTSS applicants will not need to go through a MART review to determine disability. However, they will have to go through a Level of Care Assessment in order to determine the services they can avail.  The minimum age for LTSS clients is 18 years old with the exception of SSI ? LTSS. For this type of assistance, there is no minimum age limit as the SSI criteria supersedes LTSS criteria. 


LTSS clients can be MAGI-eligible, QHP-eligible, Sherlock-eligible, or receive SSI. A client can receive coverage through MAGI, QHP or SSI while they are awaiting the clinical review for level of care authorization. 

Below is the overall process flow for an applicant requesting long-term care.



 


In RIBridges, an applicant is considered for Long-Term Support Services (LTSS) as part of the complex (DHS-2) Medicaid workflow. An applicant who indicates that they require assistance with daily living in the Special Circumstances screen will be prompted to proceed to the DHS-2 application to be evaluated for complex Medicaid.  

If the client continues with the DHS-2 application and completes an application registration, the following decisions occur: 

* Did the applicant complete a DHS-2 application
* Did the applicant request long-term support services
Following are the steps involved in LTSS determination:
> If the client requires support for daily living activities and DHS-2 application is submitted, then a task is created to LTSS unit to process the application. 
> LTSS Unit uses the level of care work flow to initiate LOC review. At that point of time, if eligibility is run, system will show LTSS Medicaid in ?Pending? status.
> Once the LOC determination is completed, the LTSS Unit logs that information in the system as either ?Approved? or ?Denied?. Based on this, eligibility determination results for LTSS can be either Approved or Denied.
> Care planning is required for authorization of services. If the Care Planning not completed, then system will show LTSS Medicaid as Approved, yet they are not authorized for any LTSS service. In these circumstance, post eligibility treatment of income will be not computed.
Categories of LTSS:
Medicaid LTSS Eligibility CriteriaEligibility CategoryIncomeResourceSpecial CriteriaInsurance ExclusionPersonal EffectsPost Eligibility Treatment of IncomeSSISSI LevelN/AReview Transfer of AssetsN/AN/AN/ASpecial Income
42 CFR 435.236<= 300% SSI
42 CFR 435.1005$4000At least 30 days in institution$4000 Face Value$5000Yes217-look alike HCBS
42 CFR 435.217<= 300% SSI
42 CFR 435.1005$4000Would be eligible if in an institution or in absence of service would need institutional care
42 CFR 435.217 (a) (b)$4000 Face Value$5000HCBS Maintenance of Need at 100% FPL+$20Expansion (MAGI population)<=133% FPL$4000Not Medicare eligible or enrolled; Subject to transfer of assets$4000 Face Value$5000YesMedically Needy<= 300% SSI
42 CFR 435.1005$4000$4000 Face Value$5000HCBS Maintenance of Need at 100% FPL+$20

The Level of Care Assessment process flow described below is very similar to that for Katie Beckett. While an LTSS client does not require a MART review, they will need to have a Level of Care Assessment determined. Sherlock and SSI Medicaid clients who request LTSS will also have to meet the Level of Care Assessment criteria to receive LTSS benefits.  A task will be generated for the LTSS Unit 90 days prior to the renewal date of the Level of Care.  The system will not take any automatic action on the LTSS case even if the Level of Care Assessment has expired. 

Below is the Level of Care Process flow which is similar to that for Katie Beckett - 




LTSS Medicaid ? Group Composition

A client is considered to be applying for Medicaid-funded LTSS in the HCBS or institutional-setting, if they meet the following conditions:
* Has completed a DHS-2 application and
* Indicates that they need assistance in performing daily activities in the Special Circumstances screen in the MAGI flow and
* Is over the age of 18 (except for SSI ? LTSS where there is no minimum age limit) and 
* Has a Level of Care in a Pending Status
Only the LTSS applicant is considered in the LTSS EDG in determining their eligibility for LTSS.  Their community partner, dependents and dependents of the community partner will be included as ?excluded? members of the EDG. As part of the post-eligibility financial determination, the LTSS applicant?s community partner and dependents will be included in determining their cost of care.  If the community partner is on LTSS Medicaid or SSI Medicaid then their income and resources are not considered.

For MAGI LTSS applicant is considered in the LTSS EDG in determining their eligibility for MAGI LTSS. Their community partner, dependents and dependents of the community partner will be included as ?Filing? unit members of the EDG. During Resource Eligibility only applicant?s resources are considered. They are eligible for CSRS deductions towards their resource countable value. 

The LTSS EDG group is created when the user submits a DHS-2 application and runs eligibility determination.  If the client is potentially LTSS-eligible, an LTSS ? Pending case is created when the case is in Intake mode.  An LTSS-Pending case can be created in the Case Change mode if a new Level of Care is initiated after the initial eligibility determination. 

Following are the variants of LTSS Medicaid with some additional criteria that is required for building their group composition:
> SSI with LTSS
> Special Income (in addition to above group composition criteria, individual indicates that they are aged, blind or disabled).
> HCBS Waiver (in addition to above group composition criteria, individual indicates that they are aged, blind or disabled).
> Medically Needy (in addition to above group composition criteria, individual indicates that they are aged, blind or disabled).
> MAGI Expansion 

A person is evaluated for LTSS ? Special Income if 
1. They have a Nursing Home or Hospital LOC and 
2. They have Highest or Hospital Care Level and
3. They are in an Institutional program type or Unknown (no) program type.  
In this situation, they would be living in a facility like a nursing home, hospital, private psychiatric hospital etc. They cannot be in multiple facilities at the same time. When a person moves from Institutional program to a non-institutional program, the TOA for the person will change from LTSS ? Special Income to LTSS ? HCBS (as long as they meet other criteria). 

If a person is in the 217 ? HCBS Waiver TOA, they need to have ? 
1. Any assessment type (except Katie Beckett) and
2. Highest, High, Hospital or Preventive Care Level and
3. Program type that is not institutional.
In this situation, the user could be living in an Assisted Living facility, Group Home, PACE, Hab Waiver etc.  The user is able to enter multiple Plans of Care (non-overlapping) to record the client?s movements between programs. Within one plan of care, if the client is in the community, a client can receive multiple community services at the same time. 


Their Financial pathway is discussed in detail in the below section.

LTSS Medicaid ? Non-Financial
Applicants are expected to meet the following non-financial characteristics in order to be determined eligible for LTSS Medicaid: 

* Must be a resident of Rhode Island
* Must be a citizen of the United States or a Lawfully Present Non-Citizen
* Must not be incarcerated
* Must provide a valid SSN
* Must report access to public or non-public MEC
* Must have a level of care determination
Note: LTSS clients are not subject to a MART disability determination process. 

 
LTSS Medicaid ? Financial
Only the LTSS client?s income and resources are used for the initial determination of financial eligibility.  During Resource eligibility, community spouse resource allowance is deducted from the total countable asset value. 

Following are the Eligibility path ways for LTSS Medicaid clients.


LTSS Medicaid Eligibility Path WaysCurrent Medicaid BeneficiariesResourceSSIN/ASpecial Income 
FPL <= 300% SSI)$4000HCBS Waiver 
(217-like)
(<= 300% SSI)$4000Medically Needy / Flex
(> 300% SSI)$4000MAGI Expansion
( 133% FPL)$4000
MAGI ? LTSS eligibility:  For a client to be considered MAGI ? LTSS (Cat Elig or Med Needy), they will need to meet the MAGI income criteria. When evaluated for resources, they will need to meet the LTSS resources criteria. 

SSI ? LTSS  eligibility: For a client to be considered SSI ? LTSS eligible, they will need to meet the SSI income limits. This is determined by the Social Security Administration. Once they are approved as SSI-eligible, they will only be evaluated based on the LTSS resource criteria to be evaluated for SSI ? LTSS eligibility. 

At the point of application, the following incomes are considered as part of the income calculation for an individual ? 
* Earned Income
* Self-Employment Income
* Title II (Social Security Benefits)
* Rental Income
* Other Unearned Income

The following resources are considered as part of the resource calculation for an individual ? 
* Liquid
* Burial
* Vehicle
* Real Property
* Life Insurance
* Trust
* Lump sum
Post-Eligibility Cost of Care:

?Cost of care calculations will be done only if the Level of Care Services are authorized. If the services are not authorized then cost of care calculation is not done by the system. It will display as $0.00. This information is not sent to MMIS.?

All LTSS clients are responsible for a patient share portion for their cost of care. This monthly cost of care is calculated as part of the post-eligibility process. In the determination of patient share, the following people will be considered as part of the group composition ? 
* LTSS applicant
* Community spouse
* LTSS applicant?s dependents
* Community spouse?s dependents
In determining the patient share amount, the income and resources are taken into account, with certain allowable deductions and disregards. The remaining income will then be used to determine the patient share. 

The allowable income deductions in calculating the cost of care are ? 

1. Personal Needs Deduction or $90 Reduced Pension Deductions
2. Community Spouse Allowance
3. Community Dependent Allowance
4. Medical Insurance Premiums
5. Medical/Remedial Items
6. Home Maintenance Deductions
7. First/Last Month Institutional Expenses 

LTSS Medicaid ? Verifications

There are no expected changes in the verifications process for LTSS Medicaid. If a client also applies for LTSS, they will be subject to LTSS verifications process, where applicable.  Detailed specifications of the verifications process is outlined in 03 18-P2-Process Doc-Eligibility-Automation of Verification for Complex Medicaid.

LTSS Medicaid ? Renewals
LTSS cases will be renewed annually. The LTSS worker will have to manually renew the Level of Care Assessment. Details for the renewal process can be found in the 03.19-P2-ProcessDoc-Eligibility-Passive Renewal.

LTSS Medicaid ? Screens and Tables
The LTSS Unit will have access to initiate and edit the Level of Care Assessment screens. The Level of Care screens are included in the Design Artifacts Inserted Section of this document. The new tables developed to capture the Level of Care information is also included in the Design Artifacts Inserted Section of this document. 

Once eligibility determination is run, LTSS Medicaid will also display the following post-eligibility screens.  The post-eligibility screens are included in the Design Artifacts Inserted section of this document. 

LTSS Medicaid ? Tasks/Alerts/Mass Updates
* For a new DHS-2 Medicaid application, after eligibility determination for MAGI programs, if the client is determined potentially eligible for LTSS Medicaid, a task is created to the LTSS Unit to evaluate the case. 
* A task is created to the SSI Unit to close a SSI eligibility when the Level of Care is authorized and eligibility is run again. 
* A task is created to the LTSS Unit 90 days before an authorized Level of Care Assessment is due to expire. **Please note that no action will be taken on an LTSS case even if the Level of Care Assessment is past due.**
* LTSS will be part of regular Medicaid case instead of separate case. When LTSS worker runs eligibility system will determine eligibility only for Medicaid and MPP program. If the same case has other public assistance programs a task will be generated to change queue to review information updated and determine eligibility public assistance programs.

LTSS Medicaid ? Security
* The LTSS Unit will have read-write access to the Level of Care screens. 
* The LTSS Unit will have the security to clear LTSS tasks. 
* Access to the Level of Care screens for other users is defined in the Level of Care section. 
* LTSS will be part of regular Medicaid case instead of separate case. When LTSS worker runs eligibility system will allow LTSS Unit to Approve/Certify only for Medicaid and MPP program. If the same case has other public assistance programs a task will be generated to change queue to review information updated and determine eligibility public assistance programs.

LTSS Medicaid ? Batches/Interfaces
The following batches/interfaces will be impacted by this change:
MMIS Interface
The MMIS interface will include information on Level of Care Assessment and Plan of Care Services being sent to MMIS. There are three transaction files impacted by the Level of Care and Plan of Care Services. They are ? 
1. E Transaction - The Level of Care information will be included as part of the E transaction. 
2. G Transaction - The Waiver Code and Plan of Care information will be included as part of the existing G transaction. In addition to this, the 1G transaction will contain a new Acuity Level field that will be send to MMIS. 
3. U Transaction ? This is a new transaction that will include details for all authorized services for a plan of care. The U transaction is triggered when there is an addition or modification to specific Plan of Care Services only. 

1E Transaction: 

An MMIS ?1E? transaction is triggered when a Level of Care Assessment is authorized and at least one of the institutional program has been authorized.

When the Level of Care Assessment end date has expired, it is expected that worker will update level of care assessment and reevaluate eligibility. RIBridges will trigger a new transaction being sent upon the renewal of the level of care assessment. If a Level of Care Assessment does not have an End Date, the LOC Assessment will remain open until the user changes it in RIBridges.

G Transactions:

The G transaction has the following file structure. The system send out a 1G Transaction to MMIS whenever the Community-based Program Types (Waiver Codes) are added/updated. Additionally, the system send out 3G Transaction to MMIS whenever the Program Type (Waiver codes) are cancelled. If an individual is no longer eligible for LTSS then 4G Transaction is sent out.

U Transactions:
RIBRIDGES sends out 1U Transaction only when services are authorized or an authorized service is modified for LTSS Community Programs. It is triggered ONLY when the Prior Authorization Status for the particular service is ?Authorized?. If the Prior Authorization Status ?Not Required? or blank, the service is not sent to MMIS through the 1U transaction. It is possible for an individual to have multiple services authorized for the same duration. The 1U transaction is applicable only to certain, pre-defined service types and the system will translate the Service Type and Frequency to determine the Procedure code to be sent to MMIS.  The 1U transaction is triggered from both Data Collection screens as well as when there is a change to the Plan of Care Services from the main Menu bar through the ?Others? navigation. In this instance, the trigger is created through the Plan of Care ? Details/Services screen and the user does not have to run eligibility to re-determine eligibility or to send the 1U transaction to MMIS.

Additionally, the system sends out 3U and 4U Transactions for cancellation and Terminations of LTSS Community Program services. 

Below is the structure for the 1U, 3U and 4U transactions -

Batch ? LOC Renewal
This batch will be used to create tasks for case workers when the level of care assessment is due for renewal. 

Batch Logic: 
1. Gather all the cases that have an approved Level of Care determination within 90 days of the batch run. 
2. Verify that there is no existing level of care determination with a begin date greater than the selected level of care end date for the same client. 
3. If the case is an LTSS case, create a task for the LTSS Unit worker for Level of Care renewal.  The alert text should state ?Level of Care determination for case due for renewal. Please review case and take the necessary action.?
4. If the case is a Katie Beckett case, and the level of care determination is due for renewal, create a task for the Katie Beckett Unit worker. The alert text should state ?Level of Care determination for case due for renewal. Please review case and take the necessary action.?
5. At the end of the batch, create a log file to report the successful run of the batch. 
6. End of batch. 

LTSS Medicaid ? Notices

If the both the spouses/parent are determined MPP eligible then their income is NOT deemed. They are counted together and tested against the Family size of 2.
Note: If the spouse/parent is Long Term Care client or Community/HCBS client then there is no deeming of their income and resources towards the eligible spouse/child.
* QMB Eligibility is determined from the next month of application date. For new applications, for the month of application, we should not be cascading down the eligibility to SLMB to QI-1 if their income is under 100% FPL. Retro Medicaid coverage cannot be requested for QMB. 
* SLMB Eligibility is determined from the application month. Retro Medicaid coverage can be requested for SLMB. 
* QI-1 Eligibility is determined from the application month, however if the application date is prior to calendar year then eligibility is determined from the Calendar year begin date. Client who is not eligible for Medicaid is evaluated for QI-1. If the client is determined Medicaid eligible, then they are not eligible for QI-1.
For example: if the application date is 12/02/2014 and eligibility is determined on 01/15/2014 then individual is determined eligible only from 01/01/2014. 
Retro Medicaid coverage can be requested for QI-1. However it can be requested only within a calendar year. If the application date is 02/02/2014 then Retro coverage can be requested only from 01/01/2014.
During Eligibility determination, if the client is not eligible for QMB because their application month is denied due to the reason that they cannot receive QMB for application month. However, they meet all the criteria?s of QMB eligibility then, system should not cascade down to SLMB or QI-1. It should not show any records for application month. 
Note: SSI clients will have their QMB approved in SSI case, if they meet the QMB criteria.
Individuals and spouses income and resources are considered during group composition.

3.14 DCYF Medicaid
DCYF administrates five different kinds of Medicaid.   Namely,
* Adoption Subsidy with Title IV-E
* Adoption Subsidy without Title IV-E
* Foster Care with Title IV-E
* Foster Care without Title IV-E
* State Adoption Subsidy
* MA - Chafee
Whenever application type is selected as ?DCYF Medicaid? in program request screen then system shall evaluate for following categories of assistance.
Adoption Subsidy with Title IV-E
This coverage group include the adopted children under 18, who are eligible for Title IV-E adoption subsidy program.  Child becomes ineligible under the following circumstances.
* Child is aged out.
* Child is removed from DCYF Adoption Subsidy program.
* Child is deceased.
* Child is moved out of the state.
Foster Care with Title IV-E
This coverage group include the foster children under 21, who are eligible for Title IV-E for foster care maintenance program. 
Adoption Subsidy without Title IV-E
This coverage group include the adopted children under 21, who are eligible for department ward adoption subsidy program.  Child becomes ineligible under the following circumstances.
* Child is aged out.

* Child is deceased.
* Child is moved out of the state.
Foster Care without Title IV-E
This coverage group includes foster children under 21 who are eligible for department ward for foster care maintenance program. 
State Adoption Subsidy
This coverage group is for children between the age of 18 and 21 who have been adopted and not eligible for federal subsidies.
Other Rules
There is no Financial or Verification requirement for DCYF Medicaid. The system will generate notices when a case is approved or closed in RIBridges.  These are Shell cases to issue Medical Benefits for DCYF children.
3.15 Creation of Duplicate Accounts
The system currently does not allow individuals to get health insurance coverage simultaneously across two different accounts/cases. This ensures that an individual does not get double-coverage of subsidized health insurance. However, there are some situations where individuals should be allowed to have active coverage across two separate cases. This is particularly true when a parent is court-ordered to provide unsubsidized coverage for a child who has subsidized health insurance in another case. Similarly, the system currently does not will allow an individual active on a SHOP account through the Exchange to apply for benefits through an independent individual account simultaneously.  
In order for the system to ensure that a client receives sufficient but not duplicate coverage, the system will have to make the following changes ? 
1. The customer portal will need to allow for an individual to exist in multiple active accounts across account types, as detailed below.
2. The worker portal will need to allow an admin user to override the restriction for a client to get health coverage across two individual accounts. 
3. Eligibility will need to ensure that a person does not have subsidized health coverage simultaneously across two separate accounts/cases. 
4. Eligibility will need to allow for a person to have subsidized and unsubsidized health coverage simultaneously across two separate accounts/cases. 

Screen Edits across Customer and Worker Portal

1. Customer Portal ? 
In the customer portal, the ?You and Your Family Members? page currently has an edit that prevents users from creating and being active in multiple accounts based on their SSN. If a user tries to add someone who already exists in the system with the same SSN, the client gets an edit stating that the person with the same SSN already receives benefits. This prevents the client from adding this person to the second account. 

This edit needs to be relaxed under certain circumstances. The types of accounts where a client can exist in more than one account are ? 
SHOP AccountIndividual AccountBroker AccountNavigator AccountSHOP AccountNOT ALLOWEDALLOWEDALLOWEDALLOWEDIndividual AccountALLOWEDNOT ALLOWEDALLOWEDALLOWEDBROKER AccountALLOWEDALLOWEDNOT ALLOWEDALLOWEDNavigator AccountALLOWEDALLOWEDALLOWEDNOT ALLOWED
In other words, a person cannot be active in two SHOP accounts, or two individual accounts etc. In these circumstances, the screen will throw an edit stating that the person already exists. However, if a person in a SHOP account attempts to be included in an individual account, the system will not prevent them from being active recipients in two separate accounts. Similarly, in the worker portal, the system will not prevent a user from being added in the Program Request screen. 

If a user tries to create an account in one of the ?Not Allowed? conditions, the system will display an error message for a duplicate account. 


Modification in Eligibility Determination:

Currently, eligibility rules ensure that a person does not get coverage for the same program across multiple accounts/cases for the same period of time. This ensures that the person does not get duplicate coverage across accounts. This rule will continue in effect for all programs, including private insurance. A person cannot get overlapping coverage for subsidized private insurance or Medicaid across accounts/cases. 

A client can get duplicate coverage across accounts/cases simultaneously under very specific scenarios.  If the client can request for coverage across two independent accounts (getting through the screen edits which allows a client to request coverage only in certain circumstances), eligibility will further ensure that they do not get duplicate coverage. The only circumstance in which they get duplicate coverage is if they are applying for health insurance in one account and unsubsidized health insurance in the second account. To do this, they would have not selected the ?Requesting Financial Assistance? checkbox in the Program Request screen. This implies that they client requests unsubsidized health coverage. Similarly, if they exist in one account with unsubsidized health coverage, they can be found eligible for Medicaid or subsidized QHP in the other account.

The table below illustrates the type of medical insurance an individual can be eligible for across two different accounts. 

Medicaid(MAGI and Complex)Subsidized QHPUnsubsidized QHPMedicaid(MAGI and Complex)NOT ALLOWEDNOT ALLOWEDALLOWEDSubsidized QHPNOT ALLOWEDNOT ALLOWEDALLOWEDUnsubsidized QHPALLOWEDALLOWEDALLOWED

When the user runs eligibility, the system will have an edit to check for the combination of coverage across multiple accounts. If the client has Medicaid in the first account and are eligible for Medicaid for subsidized QHP in the second account as well, they will be denied benefits with the notice text as ?Individual is already receiving health coverage in another account.?

If the client has Medicaid or subsidized QHP in the first account, they will be allowed to receive unsubsidized QHP in the second account. Similarly, if the client has unsubsidized QHP in the first account, they will be allowed to receive subsidized QHO or Medicaid in the second account. 


3.16 Other Miscellaneous Changes
The following changes need to be made in order to accommodate additional requirements reqarding processing eligibility in RIBridges. 
Task Generation Functionality
The system will allow and accommodate for workers identified as requiring further supervision. These workers will not be able to authorize any eligibility unless there is second party/supervisory review.  The workers are identified as needing second party review in their user profiles. Based on this identification, they will be able to run eligibility in a case but will not be able to authorize the eligibility. Once supervisory approval has been received, the users will be able to authorize eligibility. 
The Eligibility process will use the flag in the worker profile to identify if the Authorize button on the Finalize Eligibility screen will be displayed. If the worker is identified as requiring second party review, the eligibility process will display or not display the Authorize button. 

Partial Authorization/Disposition
The system will enforce the partial disposition of cases based on the user profile and security profile of the logged in user.  The following conditions are enforced to ensure that specialized cases are authorized only by particular units ? 
b. An LTSS program can be authorized only by a user identified as belonging to the LTC unit. This is based on their security profile identified. If a case has both LTSS and a DHS program or a non-LTSS health insurance, the LTSS Unit will be able to authorize only the LTSS eligibility. The other programs will not be authorized by the LTSS unit. 
c. A Katie Becket program can be authorized only by a user identified as belonging to the Katie Beckett unit. This is based on their identified security profile. If a case has both Katie Beckett and another DHS program or a non-Katie Beckett health insurance, the Katie Beckett worker can authorize only the Katie Beckett eligibility. 
d. Contact Center workers will be identified by their security profiles. Users belonging to this security profile can authorize only MAGI and private health insurance. They will not be able to authorize other DHS programs. 
e. Eligibility Technicians will be able to authorize all programs except for LTSS and Katie Beckett. 
Excluding Specified Individuals from Medicaid
The system will prevent or close eligibility of certain ?banned? individuals from receiving Medicaid. In certain situations, CMS notifies the agency of individuals who have been committing Medicaid fraud and should be banned from receiving Medicaid during the timeframe that they are banned.  The Admin will be able to use the Fraud Request screens in RIBridges to indicate that the person has committed fraud. The Sanction Start and End Dates indicate the period of time that the individual is banned from being eligible for Medicaid. The updated eligibility information is sent to MMIS accordingly.

If the person has existing Medicaid eligibility, the Admin will use the Eligibility Override functionality to close the individual?s eligibility. This will override the system-calculated eligibility and the client will be closed. The system will trigger the CNE and Medicaid Termination Notices. The individual can be evaluated for QHP/APTC/CSR eligibility.  When the eligibility for the individual is re-run, the rules will consider that this individual is ?banned? from Medicaid and deny Medicaid until the sanction end date, if applicable. 

If CMS provides the agency with a client who is not currently receiving or enrolled in Medicaid, the system will allow the  user to create the individual in the system. If the client were to apply for Medicaid, they should not be eligible for Medicaid based on the indicator that they are banned from Medicaid for fraud. 

Adverse Action for Medicaid Termination ? if an individual is identified for fraud, the individual is given 15 days for adverse action prior to their Medicaid termination date. 
* If the fraud is reported before the 15th of the month, the Medicaid eligibility is terminated as of the end of the month. 
o For example if the Sanction Start Date is November 13th, the Medicaid eligibility is terminated as of November 30th. 
* If the fraud is reported after the 15th of the month, the Medicaid eligibility is terminated as of the end of the following month, giving them 15 days of adverse action. 
o For example, if the Sanction Start Date is November 15th, the Medicaid eligibility is terminated as of December 31st. 
* If an excluded person has their sanction reversed, they would now have a Sanction End Date on their Fraud Request record. If the Sanction End Date is prior to the 15th of the month, they can be Medicaid eligible as of the 1st of the same month. 
o For example, if the Sanction End Date is identified as November 13th, they can be made Medicaid Eligible as of November 1st. 
* If the person has a Sanction End Date on the 15th or later, the person will be Medicaid eligible as of the 1st of the next month. 
o For example, if the Sanction End Date is identified as November 15th they can be Medicaid eligible as of December 1st. 

The screens for identifying the individuals banned from being eligible for Medicaid will be recorded in the 05 11 02_SF_FM_FMCBR_CreateFraudBenefitRequest. 

Below is the process flow for identifying and processing who should be excluded from Medicaid ?

3.18 Interfaces ? MMIS
As part of MMIS Eligibility Transaction, a new transaction called as ?2B? is added in addition to existing ?1B? ,?3B? and ?4B? transaction.
2B Transaction is used to send the historic (retro Medicaid) coverage to MMIS system, whenever the client doesn?t have eligibility for the historic period. Expectation is to have the Eligibility Begin Date and End Date in the past period as part of the 2B Transaction.
Scenario 1: Client is applying for Medicaid with Application date of 04/10/2015 and determined eligible on 04/10/2015. 1B Transaction is sent to MMIS with Eligibility Start Date as 04/01/2015. Later on client continued to apply for Retro coverage for prior month?s i.e, Jan 2015, Feb 2015 and March 2015 through DHS-2 application/Health Insurance application. Worker processed the retro coverage on 04/20/2015. In this case only Retro Months (01/2015,02/2015,03/2015) should be sent as ?2B? to MMIS.

Scenario 2: Client is applying for MAGI and determined eligible. However requested Retro coverage. Worker is processing retro coverage on same day. In this scenario only Retro Months should be sent as 2B along 1B to MMIS. The HP enrollment system (MMIS) will accept two ?B? transactions on same day as long as one of the transaction is ongoing with no end date whereas the other retro has start and end dates which do not overlap with the ongoing transaction. Application date here is some date in 3rd month hence MAGI starts prospectively from 1st of 4th month.

Scenario 3: Client is eligible for MAGI Medicaid on the current month which is 3rd month. The dependent children are aging out. Hence the parents move to CX effective next (4th month) month. That means LIF aid category code for the parents closes end of the month in which dependents age out.

Scenario 4: Client is currently eligible for MAGI Medicaid as CHIP effective 07/1/2014. Client has reported a change as well as aging out of the system effective 08/01/2015. In this scenario New Aid Category should be set prospectively.

Business Layer Design

Class Diagram
This class diagram describes the component association that exists between service layer and data persistence layer. The diagram components focus on Medicaid Eligibility Process and represent the class used in Medicaid determination. Further details regarding the technical design that details the coding structure of the application and its classes can be found in the Architecture Technical Bulletin at - RI Technical Design. 


> EdUtil: 
This Class contains the Driver i.e., Entry Class for determining eligibility. This module invokes following submodule:
* EDG
* Non-Financial
* Financial
* Resource
* Verification
> EgDriver/IEgManager: 
This class is the EDG Driver, which is invoked from EdUtil. This components, determines following:
* Determines the program group composition eligibility by running OPA Group composition rules engine.
* Loads Entities
* Unloads Entities
* Passes data from Data Access Object(DAO) layer
* Runs eligibility for each month.
> NFManager:
This class is used for Non-Financial characteristics determination. This class invokes NFEntityLoader to pass data to OPA. NFEntityWriter to read data from OPA and store them in database.
> FinManager:
This class is used for Financial eligibility determination. This class invokes FinFmaEntityLoader to pass data to Financial module of the rules engine. FinFmaEntityWriter to read data from OPA and store them in database. These classes specified are used during Medicaid eligibility determination
> VCLManager: 
This class is used for Verification eligibility determination. This class invokes VCLEntityLoader to pass data to Verification module of the rules engine. VCLEntityWriter to read data from OPA and store them in database.


Exception Handling
Eligibility Application layer will throw the EDBCException when exception happens and it will be caught in Service layer. FrameworkException is used to wrap around it. Logging of exception is done at the service level. Service methods will be throwing the GenericValidationException to controller layer. Transaction manager will take care of rollback. For more details regarding the lay out the coding structure of the app and the way it traps for errors can be found in the Architecture Technical Bulletin at - RI Technical Design. 


Exception NameException Class NameRemarksEDBCExceptionus.ri.eohhs.uhip.ies.framework.exception. EDBCExceptionEDBCException  is represent the exceptions  thrown by EDBC components and the actions that could be performed when  exceptions occur.GenericValidationExceptionus.ri.eohhs.uhip.ies.framework.exception. GenericValidationExceptionGenericValidationException is used to report any exception related to the validation of Tiers data. This is used to report any server side validation and framework history validations.FrameworkExceptionus.ri.eohhs.uhip.ies.framework.exception. FrameworkExceptionFrameworkException is used by the framework to report any 
 exception that occurs during the framework process.ApplicationExceptionus.ri.eohhs.uhip.ies.framework.exception. ApplicationExceptionThis class provides a wrapper for all the application exceptions.  This is the super class for all the application level exceptions.
Caching
The Common Frameworks have provided APIs which get all the lookup data and cache it along with the APIs to get the data. Those have been used in our Reference Dao Layers to get the data used in our application and methods have been written in ReferenceServices to access the LookupData. Caching is also done at the OPA sever level.  Further details regarding the lay out of the APIs and the way lookup data is loaded to memory can be found in the Architecture Technical Bulletin at - RI Technical Design.

Persistent Layer Design
